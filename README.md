## Overview

Academic certificate verification is often plagued by issues of forgery and inefficiency. This blockchain-based solution seeks to resolve these challenges by storing certificates on a decentralized ledger, where they can be validated securely and transparently. By leveraging smart contracts, this system allows authorized institutions to issue, store, and verify certificates without reliance on a central authority.

## Features

- **Decentralized Verification:** Using blockchain to ensure that all certificates are immutable and can be verified by anyone with access.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automates certificate issuance and verification, ensuring only authorized institutions can interact with the system.
- **Transparency and Security:** All interactions, from certificate creation to validation, are logged on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof.
- **Reduced Fraud:** A public ledger drastically reduces the chance of counterfeit certificates, providing greater trust for employers and institutions.

## Project Structure

- `/contracts`: Contains the smart contract files that manage certificate creation and verification.
- `/frontend`: Holds the frontend code to interact with the blockchain.
- `/backend`: Includes the backend code for interacting with the blockchain and managing requests.
- `/migrations`: Migration scripts for deploying contracts to the blockchain network.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum (or another blockchain, as applicable)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Web3 Integration**: Web3.js (or Ethers.js)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (or another Ethereum wallet)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratyushdube/Certificate-Verification-thru-blockchain.git
   cd Certificate-Verification-thru-blockchain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile and migrate the smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   .
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   http-server
   ```

5. **Run the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract:** Run the migration to deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain.
2. **Issue Certificates:** Authorized users can create certificates by interacting with the contract.
3. **Verify Certificates:** Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate by checking its details on the blockchain.
